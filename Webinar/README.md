# `Machine Learning and Deep Learning`

## Table of contents

* [Machine Learning](#machine-learning)
	* [Machine Learning Algorithms](#machine-learning-algorithms)

* Artificial intelligence (AI) is the broad science of mimicking human abilities, machine learning is a specific subset of AI that trains a machine how to learn.

## Machine Learning

> * **Machine learning is a field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly(clearly) programmed**.
* Machine learning techniques are used to automatically find the valuable underlying patterns within complex data that we would otherwise struggle to discover. The hidden patterns and knowledge about a problem can be used to predict future events and perform all kinds of complex decision making.

* Tom Mitchell provides a more modern definition: “A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.


### Machine Learning Algorithms

* Supervised Learning 
* Unsupervised Learning
* Reinforcement Learning

## Supervised Learning

* Supervised learning is when the model is getting trained on a labelled dataset.
* Labelled dataset is one which have both input and output parameters.

	* Example
	* *Given data about the area of houses and their price, try to predict their price for new area.*

### Types of supervised learning
* Regression
* Classification

#### Regression
* Here we are trying to predict results within a continuous output, meaning that we are trying to map input variables to some continuous function.
* Given a picture of a person, We have to predict his/her age(Continuous).

#### Classification
* Here we are trying to map input variables into discrete categories. 
* Given a picture of a person, We have to predict their gender (Male/Female) (Discrete).
